    "TD3 is an improvement on the DDPG algorithm and introduces three main changes to that algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Double Q Learning** two networks are \"twinned\" and learn at the same time\n",
    "2. **Added Noise** noise is added to the policy actions\n",
    "3. **Delayed Updates** updates to the policy network, it's target network and the twin target network are delayed."

    "Where $\\epsilon$ is clipped white noise, $\\gamma$ is the discount factor determining the agentâ€™s horizon, $\\theta_i$ are the parameters of the $Q$-network at iteration $i$ and $\\theta_i^{-}$ are the $Q$-network parameters used to compute the target at iteration $i$. The target network parameters $\\theta^{\\prime}_i$ are only updated with the $Q$-network parameters $\\theta_i$ every $C$ steps and are frozen between individual updates. $C$ is usually 2 (so updates are applied every other step)."
